# countNumerals.cpp

Counts how many of each digit appears in a list of numbers from the specified
lower bound to the specified upper bound, inclusive.

For example, if the given lower bound is 2, and the upper bound is 17, then
there are 1 0's (10), 9 1's (1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17), 2 2's (2, 12),
2 3's (3, 13), etc.
